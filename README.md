# Iris Flower Classification

## Task Objectives
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning classification model to accurately identify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The key objectives include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying significant features influencing classification.
- **Model Selection & Training**: Choosing an appropriate classification model and training it.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using suitable metrics.
- **Deployment & Documentation**: Providing a structured repository with organized code and clear documentation.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook and open `Iris Flower Classification.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - Follow the structured steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

5. **Analyze Results**:
   - The notebook includes performance metrics and visualizations to understand model accuracy.

## Code Structure

- `Iris Flower Classification.ipynb` - Contains the end-to-end implementation of the classification model.
- `README.md` - Documentation of the project.
- `data/` - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

## Model Evaluation
The classification model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Expected Outcome
A machine learning model with high accuracy in classifying Iris flower species, along with an organized and well-documented GitHub repository containing code, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation details.
